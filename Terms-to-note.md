1. *Props drilling* <br>
Prop drilling is a situation where data is passed from one component through multiple interdependent components until you get to the component where the data is needed. To solve the prop drilling issue, we have State Management Solutions like Context API and Redux.<br>

2. *Event Bubbling* <br>
Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.<br>
